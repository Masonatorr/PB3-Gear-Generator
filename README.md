# PB3-Gear-Generator
A program to easily create gears of different shapes and sizes.

This program is relatively self explanatory, but I will give some extra info here:


## Gear Type:
This is the type of gear that will be created. These are the four types currently available:
1. Triangle Tooth Spur Gear
2. Trapezoidal Tooth Spur Gear
3. Triangle Tooth Ring Gear
4. Trapezoidal Tooth Ring Gear

![Trapezoidal Tooth Spur Gear](https://github.com/Masonatorr/PB3-Gear-Generator/assets/42453670/dd277978-750b-44b4-89c8-ded285cb7f6e "Trapezoidal Tooth Spur Gear")
![Triangle Tooth Ring Gear](https://github.com/Masonatorr/PB3-Gear-Generator/assets/42453670/80686a40-066b-4e1a-890d-06a6cda1163d "Triangle Tooth Ring Gear")
![Trapezoidal Tooth Ring Gear](https://github.com/Masonatorr/PB3-Gear-Generator/assets/42453670/459710e2-e25e-4f8a-ae1a-66ce0713c2f8 "Trapezoidal Tooth Ring Gear")  

To select which gear you want to generate, type the gear's number into the input field.

## Number of Teeth:
Self explanatory. Whatever number you enter is the number of teeth that the resulting gear will have. Increasing this number will make the teeth thinner unless you increase the gear radius.

## Gear Radius:
This one isn't as intuitive. The gear's radius is measured via this red ring here:

When the teeth are generated, the highest and lowest points of the teeth will be an equal distance away from this line.

## Tooth Height:
The tooth height controls the total height of the tooth from tip to base, as shown here:  
![Tooth height](https://github.com/Masonatorr/PB3-Gear-Generator/assets/42453670/77d97b42-797d-4a83-8131-f7185e7f692b "Tooth Height")  
As mentioned previously, the tip and base of each tooth are both an equal distance away from the gear's radius.
